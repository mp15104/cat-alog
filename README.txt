TESTING INSTRUCTIONS: 
Go to the link at http://localhost:3000/ - to test the "app" version of the website. As the website is designed as a single-page webapp, navigation should not require you manually inputting any links.

From here, you can register an account and then use said account to log in to test features such as viewing the cat catalog or inputting your own entry.

The website doesn't provide any functionality for registering an admin account, but the database comes with an admin account with the username 'rabbit' and password 'tank'. To test different accounts, you can load the website in an incognito tab. If you want to create your own admin account, you'll have to use sqlite3.
